# Photospread

## Introduction

Photospread is an online gallery for photographers and artists to display their
work in a beautiful, 3D way. Inspired by the closure of physical spaces due to
COVID-19, photospread is a virtual gallery that allows the viewing of work in
an analogue of a physical space.

This project was created during the week of the 9th of November 2020 for a General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive with the goal of learning the ins and outs of threeJS and learning to develop in a team. While there are things that could/should be updated it is not active at this time.
